# journee (beta)

A lightweight, simplified RedNotebook-type journal/diary app. Built with Electron.

### Don't chain your memories to some obscure piece of journal software.

Other diary software keeps your diary in some unique, unreadable format. People are stuck with their particular journal system, or have to struggle with tricky imports/exports.

Journee keeps your memories in the most universally accessible way possible: **a folder full of (ISO 8601 format) dated text files.**

```
2015-08-23.txt    2015-11-12.txt    2016-01-05.txt    2016-01-17.txt    2016-02-07.txt
2015-09-28.txt    2015-11-22.txt    2016-01-09.txt    2016-01-19.txt    2016-01-13.txt
2015-10-03.txt    2015-12-14.txt    2016-01-12.txt    2016-01-22.txt    2016-01-22.txt
```

You can read, access, or add to this folder any way you like. And the Journee UI provides a simple and distraction free environment for you to write and to browse through your entries on a calendar.

### Journee works great... but it's just getting started. (This is beta!)

- Search function
- Keyboard Shortcuts and explanations
